<h4>
	Create Presentation
</h4>

<ol>
	<li>
		Click on '<i class="fa fa-plus-square"></i> Add Presentation'
	</li>
	<li>
		Add the name of your surpevisor for this presentation
	</li>
	<li>
		Your name will appear in 'Student Name'. You don't have to type anything there 
		unless it's a group presentation. In this case, select 'Group' and add the name of 
		your fellow student. If you need to add more than one, just click on 
		'<i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add Student' and type the new name on 
		the empty input field.
	</li>
	<li>
		Select the course this presentation refers to (the major one in case of multiple).
	</li>
	<li>
		Add the title of your presentation
	</li>
	<li>
		Choose the type of it (if you don't know the right one, check with your professor!)
	</li>
	<li>
		If you already have an abstract ready, just type it in. If you don't, don't worry 
		for now, because it's not required until a little later. The SAC Coodinator will 
		let your professor know the deadline for this.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the SAC Coordinator needs to know anything about your presentation or your 
		schedule, or any special needs, let them know by typing it in 'Special Notes'
	</li>
	<li>
		Press '<i class="fa fa-floppy-o"></i> Save'
	</li>
</ol>
