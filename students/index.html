	</li>
	<li>
		Add the name of your surpevisor for this presentation
	</li>
	<li>
		Your name will appear in 'Student Name'. You don't have to type anything there 
		unless it's a group presentation. In this case, select 'Group' and add the name of 
		your fellow student. If you need to add more than one, just click on 
		'<i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add Student' and type the new name on 
		the empty input field.
	</li>
	<li>
		Select the course this presentation refers to (the major one in case of multiple).
	</li>
	<li>
		Add the title of your presentation
	</li>
	<li>
		Choose the type of it (if you don't know the right one, check with your professor!)
	</li>
	<li>
		If you already have an abstract ready, just type it in. If you don't, don't worry 
		for now, because it's not required until a little later. The SAC Coodinator will 
		let your professor know the deadline for this.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the SAC Coordinator needs to know anything about your presentation or your 
		schedule, or any special needs, let them know by typing it in 'Special Notes'
	</li>
	<li>
		Press '<i class="fa fa-floppy-o"></i> Save'
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	You'll be redirected to your home page, where you can see all your presentations. 
	This one that you just created will be labeled as 'Saved', 
	which means that the SAC Coordinator can't see it yet. 
	When you are done, press submit and wait for the coordinator's approval.

<p>
	As a student you can edit any of your own presentations by doing the following:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Click on the title of the presentation that will be edited. You'll be redirected to the edit page.
	</li>
	<li>
		Edit any information you desire. If you want to make this a group presentation, go ahead, the process is the same of creating a new one.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can also add your abstract if you don't have one yet.
	</li>
	<li>
		When you're done, press '<i class="fa fa-floppy-o"></i> Save'
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	You'll be redirected to your home page and will be prompted to submit the 
	presentation again if you had done that already.
</p>

<h4 id="delete">

	you intend to present it at SAC.
