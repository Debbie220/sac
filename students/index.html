	<li>
		Choose the type of it (if you don't know the right one, check with your professor!)
	</li>
	<li>
		If you already have an abstract ready, just type it in. If you don't, don't worry 
		for now, because it's not required until a little later. The SAC Coodinator will 
		let your professor know the deadline for this.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the SAC Coordinator needs to know anything about your presentation or your 
		schedule, or any special needs, let them know by typing it in 'Special Notes'
	</li>
	<li>

	</li>
	<li>
		You can also add your abstract if you don't have one yet.
	</li>
	<li>
		When you're done, press '<i class="fa fa-floppy-o"></i> Save'
	</li>
</ol>
