<h2>
	Professors
</h2>

<p>
	Professors can do anything a student can. They can also see, edit and delete any
	presentation under one of their courses. Remember that, before any of that, you
	must request a professor role in the system.
</p>

<p>
	If you are looking for other roles, check the <a href="/sac">home page</a>
</p>
<br>

<h4 id="request-role">
	Request Professor Role
</h4>

<p>
	If you are a professor at Augustana, you need to request this role after your signup!
	For security issues, every user is registered as student.
</p>

<p>
	To do that, just click on 'Request Professor Role' on your navigation bar. If your
	request is approved, you will have access to the professor home page next time you
	login.
</p>
<br>


<h4 id="add-course">
	Add courses to your profile
</h4>

<p>
	We can't access the courses you teach automatically yet and that's why you have to
	add the courses you teach to your profile. Once you do that, you'll be able to
	see (edit and delete) any presentation under that course.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Click on '<i class="fa fa-list"></i> My Courses'
	</li>
	<li>
		Select the course you want to add.
	</li>
	<li>
		Press 'Add Course'
	</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h4 id="remove-course">
	Remove courses from your profile
</h4>

<p>
	For the same reason outlined in the previous topic, you also have to manually remove
	a course from you profile when the semester is done (or at the beginning of the next
	one). You won't be prompted to confirm this action, but you can just readd the course
	if needed.
</p>

<p>
	This action doesn't delete the course. It only removes from your profile.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Click on '<i class="fa fa-list"></i> My Courses'
	</li>
	<li>
		Look for the course you want to remove in the course table.
	</li>
	<li>
		Click on '<i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i>'
	</li>
</ol>
