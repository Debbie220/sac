<h2>
	Professors
</h2>

<p>
	Professors can do anything a student can. They can also see, edit and delete any 
	presentation under one of their courses. Remember that before you can do all that, you 
	must request a professor role in the systems.
</p>

<p>
	If you are looking for other roles, check the <a href="/sac">home page</a>
</p>

<h4 id="request-role">
	Request Professor Role
</h4>

<p>
	If you are a professor at Augustana, you need to request this role after your signup! 
	For security issues, every user is registered as student.
</p>

<p>
	To do that, just click on 'Request Professor Role' on your navigation bar. If your 
	request is approved, you will have access to the professor home page next time you 
	login.
