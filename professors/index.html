	Request Professor Role
</h4>

<p>
	If you are a professor at Augustana, you need to request this role after your signup! 
	For security issues, every user is registered as student.
</p>

<p>
	To do that, just click on 'Request Professor Role' on your navigation bar. If your 
	request is approved, you will have access to the professor home page next time you 
	login.
