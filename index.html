Student Academic Conference

<br>

Since 1994, Augustana has organized a symposium at the end of each term in which undergraduate students conducting independent work for credit can present their research findings.  Classes that have conducted CSL projects are able to present their community work in this context as well.

<br>

All presentations must be registered in <a href="https://csl.augustana.ualberta.ca/sac/public"> the SAC website</a>. This manual will help you to create and submit presentations to the SAC Coordinator. If you already have an account, jump to <a href="/students">Students</a>, <a href="/professors">Professors</a> or <a href="/admin">Admin</a> to find out what to do next.
