    Creating a new Conference
  </h4>
  <p>
      Before students are able to register for their presentations, you must create a new conference.
      First, click on the <a> Rooms</a> tab and add the rooms that will be used in the conference.
      Only rooms marked as <button class="btn btn-success"> Available </button>
      will be added to the conference.  Any new presentations that are submitted
      will be assigned to the current conference, so it is important to only
      create a new conference when the current one has concluded.  To create a
      new conference:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Click <a> Create new Conference</a> on the side menu.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter the name of the conference (eg. SAC Winter 2016).
    </li>
    <li>
      Press <button class="btn btn-default"> Add a Day </button>
       to add additional days to the conference.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each day, set the start times of the first and last presentations.
        <p>
        NOTE: The 24 hour time format is used.
      </p>
      </li>
    <li>
      Press <button class="btn btn-primary">Create</button>.  This will populate
       each room with half an hour timeslots for the duration of the conference.
    </li>
